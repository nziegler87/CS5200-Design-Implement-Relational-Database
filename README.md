Practicum 1 with Danielle Tolliver. We were given an FAA CSV file with bird strike data and were tasked with building a relational database to house the data. For an existing data set from the FAA, we built a logical data model and a relational schema, realized the relational schema in MySQL, load data into an AWS database, executed SQL queries, and performed some simple analysis of the data.
