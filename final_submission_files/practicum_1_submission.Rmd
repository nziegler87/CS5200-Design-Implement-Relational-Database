# Practicum Questions

### 4. (10 pts / 1 hr) Create a SQL query against your database to find the number of bird strike incidents for each airline upon take-off or climb. Include all airlines. You may either use a {sql} code chunk or an R function to execute the query.

```{sql connection=mydb}
SELECT COUNT(BirdStrike.birdstrike_id) AS incidents
, airline_name
FROM BirdStrike
JOIN Flight
ON BirdStrike.flight_id = Flight.f_id
JOIN AirlineOperator
ON airline_operator_id = ao_id
WHERE phase_of_flight IN ('Take-off run', 'Climb') AND airline_name <> "UNKNOWN"
GROUP BY airline_name
ORDER BY incidents DESC
```

### 5. (10 pts / 1 hr) Create a SQL query against your database to find the airports that had the most bird strike incidents (during any flight phase). Include all airlines. You may either use a {sql} code chunk or an R function to execute the query.

```{sql connection=mydb}
SELECT COUNT(BirdStrike.birdstrike_id) AS incidents
, airport_name
FROM BirdStrike
JOIN Flight
ON BirdStrike.flight_id = Flight.f_id
JOIN Airport
ON origin_airport_id = a_id
GROUP BY airport_name
ORDER BY incidents DESC
```

### 6. (10 pts / 1 hr) Create a SQL query against your database to find the number of bird strike incidents by year. Include all airlines. You may either use a {sql} code chunk or an R function to execute the query.

```{sql connection=mydb}
SELECT COUNT(BirdStrike.birdstrike_id) AS incidents
, YEAR(Flight.flight_date) AS Year
FROM BirdStrike
JOIN Flight
ON BirdStrike.flight_id = Flight.f_id
WHERE YEAR(Flight.flight_date) <> "1776"
GROUP BY YEAR(Flight.flight_date)
ORDER BY Year 
```

### 7. (10 pts / 3 hrs) Using the above data, build a column chart that visualizes the number of bird strikes incidents per year from 2008 to 2011 during take-off/climbing and during descent/approach/landing. Adorn the graph with appropriate axis labels.

```{r}
# pulling the data together into a data frame

### 8. (10 pts / 3 hrs) Create a stored procedure in MySQL (note that if you used SQLite, then you cannot complete this step) that removes a bird strike incident from the database. You may decide what you need to pass to the stored procedure to remove a bird strike incident, e.g., departure airport, airlines, or some ID. Show that the deletion worked as expected.

```{sql connection=mydb}
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS Remove_BirdStrike;
```

```{sql connection=mydb}
CREATE PROCEDURE Remove_BirdStrike (
  IN birdstrike_id_to_delete INTEGER)
BEGIN
  -- Save the note_id, which will be needed for deletion later
  DECLARE delete_note_id INTEGER;
  SET delete_note_id = (SELECT BirdStrike.note_id
                        FROM BirdStrike
                        WHERE BirdStrike.birdstrike_id = birdstrike_id_to_delete);
  
  -- Remove the associated precipitation records
  DELETE FROM Precipitation WHERE Precipitation.birdstrike_id = birdstrike_id_to_delete;
  
  -- Remove the birdstrike record
  DELETE FROM BirdStrike WHERE BirdStrike.birdstrike_id = birdstrike_id_to_delete;
  
  -- Remove the note record
  DELETE FROM Note WHERE Note.n_id = delete_note_id;
  
    -- Remove the corresponding flight
  DELETE FROM Flight WHERE Flight.f_id = (SELECT BirdStrike.flight_id
                                          FROM BirdStrike
                                          WHERE BirdStrike.birdstrike_id = birdstrike_id_to_delete);

END;
```

```{sql connection=mydb}
-- Selecting record based on birdstrike_id
SELECT * FROM BirdStrike WHERE birdstrike_id = 315417;
```

```{sql connection=mydb}
